# Estimates of Population within 10km of Protected Areas (2000–2020)

The code and data in this replication package enable reproducing the results and manuscript using Google Earth Engine and R.

## Manuscript

The manuscript can be read **in html format** (webpage) at the following URL: <https://betsaka.github.io/population_near_protected_areas/Wordlpop_10km_PAs_2000-2020.html>

It is available in docx format (microsoft word) at the following URL: <https://betsaka.github.io/population_near_protected_areas/Wordlpop_10km_PAs_2000-2020.docx>

It is available in pdf format (Typst pdf output) at the following URL: <https://betsaka.github.io/population_near_protected_areas/Wordlpop_10km_PAs_2000-2020.pdf>

These 3 documents are generated by rendering the quarto notebook `Wordlpop_10km_PAs_2000-2020.qmd`

## Code

All the results can be reproduced with the files included in the `code` directory:

-   Use `code/01_compute_land_pop_estimates_GEE.js` to compute the calculations on Google Earth Engine platform and obtain the files inclduded in `data/Population_GEE_output`

-   Use `Use/02_produce_table_and_figures.R` to reproduce all the tables in figure included in the manuscript.

## Data availability

This analysis only relies on publicly available data:

-   Data available from Google Earth Engine (GEE):

    -   [WorldPop Global Project Population Data: Estimated Residential Population per 100x100m Grid Square](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WorldPop_GP_100m_pop)

    -   [WDPA: World Database on Protected Areas (polygons)](WDPA:%20World%20Database%20on%20Protected%20Areas%20(polygons))

    -   [geoBoundaries: Political administrative boundaries at Country level (ADM0), v6.0.0](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WM_geoLab_geoBoundaries_600_ADM0)

-   Data available from the World Bank portal :

    -   [World Bank historical country classification by income](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups)

A copy of the worldbank data is available on this repository. The other sources are too heavy to be copied and need to be processed on the GEE platform. The outputs of the GEE calculations (at ADM1 level for countries larger than 1,000,000 km2, at ADM0 level for the others) are available within the data folder, with names such as `Population_PAs_ADM0_ADM1_YearlyWDPA_{ISO3}` , where `ISO3` corresponds to the three-letter abbreviation of each country.
