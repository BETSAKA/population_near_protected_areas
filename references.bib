	abstract = {Background Protected areas are the first, and often only, line of defense in efforts to conserve biodiversity. They might be detrimental or beneficial to rural communities depending on how they alter economic opportunities and access to natural resources. As such, protected areas may attract or repel human settlement. Disproportionate increases in population growth near protected area boundaries may threaten their ability to conserve biodiversity. Methodology/Principal Findings Using decadal population datasets, we analyze population growth across 45 countries and 304 protected areas. We find no evidence for population growth near protected areas to be greater than growth of rural areas in the same country. Furthermore, we argue that what growth does occur near protected areas likely results from a general expansion of nearby population centers. Conclusions/Significance Our results contradict those from a recent study by Wittemyer et al., who claim overwhelming evidence for increased human population growth near protected areas. To understand the disagreement, we re-analyzed the protected areas in Wittemyer et al.'s paper. Their results are simply artifacts of mixing two incompatible datasets. Protected areas may experience unusual population pressures near their edges; indeed, individual case studies provide examples. There is no evidence, however, of a general pattern of disproportionate population growth near protected areas.},

	abstract = {Spatial data of regional populations are indispensable in studying the impact of human activities on resource utilization and the ecological environment. Because the differences between datasets and their spatial distribution are still unclear, this has become a puzzle in data selection and application. This study is based on four mainstream spatialized population datasets: the History Database of the Global Environment version 3.2.000 (HYDE), Gridded Population of the World version 4 (GPWv4), Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), and WorldPop. In view of possible influences of geographical factors, this study analyzes the differences in accuracy of population estimation by computing relative errors and population spatial distribution consistency in different regions by comparing datasets pixel by pixel. The results demonstrate the following: (1) Source data, spatialization methods, and case area features affect the precision of datasets. As the main data source is statistical data and the spatialization method maintains the population in the administrative region, the populations of GPWv4 and GHSL are closest to the statistical data value. (2) The application of remote sensing, mobile communication, and other geospatial data makes the datasets more accurate in the United Kingdom, with rich information, and the absolute value of relative errors is less than 4\%. In the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, where data are hard to obtain, the four datasets have larger relative errors. However, the area where the four datasets are completely consistent is as high as 84.73\% in Tibet, while in the UK it is only 66.76\%. (3) The areas where the spatial patterns of the four datasets are completely consistent are mainly distributed in areas with low population density, or with developed urbanization and concentrated population distribution. Areas where the datasets have poor consistency are mainly distributed in medium population density areas with high urbanization levels. Therefore, in such areas, a more careful assessment should be made during the data application process, and more emphasis should be placed on improving data accuracy when using spatialization methods.},

Quantifying the estimation accuracy of population spatial distribution has been recognized as a critical and challenging task. This study aims to evaluate the data accuracy of four population datasets in China, including three global gridded population datasets, the Gridded Population of the World (GPW), Global Rural and Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), and WorldPop project (WorldPop), and a Chinese regional gridded population dataset, the China 1 km Gridded Population (CnPop) dataset. These datasets are assessed using a specific method based on a GIS-linked 2000 census dataset at the township level in China. The results indicate that WorldPop had the highest estimation accuracy, estimating about 60\% of the total population. CnPop accurately estimated about half of the total population, showing a good mapping performance. The GPW had an acceptable estimation accuracy in a few plain and basin areas, accounting for about 30\% of the total population. Compared to the GPW, GRUMP accurately estimated about 40\% of the total population. The relative estimation error analysis discovered the disadvantages of the generation strategies of these datasets. The conclusions are expected to serve as a quality reference for potential dataset users and producers, and promote accuracy assessment for population datasets in other regions and globally.},
